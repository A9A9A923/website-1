                I have always loved the arts — In fact drawing, was the language that I would use to express my thoughts and to understand the people around me. I am innately curious; my middle school math tutor once called me an ‘inquisitive child’ during one of our lessons, and he encouraged me to never lose this character trait. Consequently, possessing this character trait was why I enjoyed learning about the human mind and behavior during my 4 years as a Psychology major, I was able to delve deep into analyzing human behavioral patterns and thought processes. <br>
                I discovered the world of UI/UX design and coding in November 2021, and I also came to understand how Psychology plays a crucial part in the world of UI/UX Design. I was thrilled to learn more because of my passion for visual design, and so I created a study curriculum and began to utilize the available resources online. <br>
                My journey as a UI/UX Developer has commenced, and I am already set on the path of applying the knowledge and skills that I am gaining by building my own projects. When it comes to solving a design challenge, I believe in upholding standards and principles that identifies the users’ needs first.
